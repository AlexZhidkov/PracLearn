      Questions that the STUDENTS might ask….

      Topic: Projects

      What is a project?

      Great question! So, a project is basically like a practical subject/unit, we’ve structured our projects to fit
      within your curriculum so you can actually get work experience as part of your degree.
      something that you work towards to achieve a particular outcome. In this case, it will be a collaborative
      enterprise between yourself and the small to medium sized business that you are connected with. For example, the
      business may require a marketing student to create, manage and grow their social media pages, this could be an
      example of a project.

      My Projects

      This lists the all projects that you have applied for. If you haven’t applied for a project, or would like to
      apply for another project, click the ‘apply for projects’ button. If you have already contacted a small to medium
      sized business and have created your own project, please click ‘bring my own’ and follow the prompts. If you have
      any further questions about the projects - please see our FAQ page.

      Project Feedback

      This refers to the feedback you receive from the small to medium sized business throughout your internship. You
      will receive feedback halfway through your internship (30 hour feedback) and then at the end of your internship
      (final feedback).

      Suggestion: Create a video for the ‘How To Get Started’ - potentially a screen recording of somebody clicking
      through making a project as a student would.
